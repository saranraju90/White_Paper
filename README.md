The Scenario

You are part of the digital analytics department of an online marketing agency. Your team has been asked to conduct a 4-hour on-site training session for one of your e-commerce startup clients. The client is a dried flower bouquet business that is currently selling on Etsy. They have outgrown the Etsy platform and want to launch their own online shop. The client has just signed the contract with you and wants your help with launching their online shop.

The companyâ€™s founder, two marketing managers, and the web developer will attend the training session. The team wants to learn about principles of sales psychology, web usability, and conversion-centered design that they can use on their website. None of the attendees invested time in learning about these topics prior to this training.

Your Task

Prepare this training session and create all the necessary material for it.

The material should include the outline for the day with approximate time slots, a slide deck with speaker notes, material for an interactive activity, and a handout
Keep your audience and their learning objectives in mind when preparing the session
